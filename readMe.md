This is a project to bruteforce to code on https://xccr.com/

Because I'm lazy I won't try every combination by myself thus I'm leting my useless algorithms and power of computers to crack the code on this very page.

Also if you see any code that doesn't related to problem itself is because I'll be trying out some different codes. They will be removed afterward ofcourse.
